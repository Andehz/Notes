15. ELB Pt. 1

Elastic load balancing. Feature, not a service in of itself.

Evenly distributes traffic between EC2 instances that are associated with it. Increases fault tolerance of applications.

If a server crashes, the ELB will re-route all users to the working servers.

Important for high availability and fault tolerance.

17. Auto scaling

Autoscaling automates the process of adding (scaling up) or removing (scaling down) EC2 instances based on traffic demand of your app.

Create scaling policies to scale up or down based on certain conditions.
