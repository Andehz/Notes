10. Simple Storage Service (S3) and Glacier

S3 - An online bulk storage service that you can access from almost any device.

Can store any file type in S3.

Root level folders are known as buckets, subfolders are just folders.

Files are referred to as objects.

Buckets must select a specific region for it to exist in.

Best practice is to select region that's physically closest to you/target end user.

Rules to creating a bucket:
-name must be unique across the entirety of AWS.
-must be 3 to 63 characters in length.
-can only contain lowercase letters, number, and hyphens
-must not be formatted as an IP address

Storage class - classification assigned to each object in S3.

Glacier technically isn't a storage class, but commonly referred to as one.

Can change storage class on demand, except for Glacier. Glacier requires more set up.

S3 Classes

Standard:
Designed for general purpose storage. Default option, and most expensive option
99.999999999% object durability (11 nines)
99.99% Object availability.

Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
Designed for objects that you don't need access frequently, but must be immediately available when accessed.
99.999999999% durability.
99.90% availability.
Somewhat less expensive.
Uses multiple availability zones.

One-Zone-IA
Designed for objects that you don't access frequently, but must be immediately available. Uses 1 availability zone.
99.99% durability
99.50% availability
~20% less expensive than standard-IA storage class.

Intelligent Tiering
Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective tier based on usage.
99.999999999% durability
99.90 availability
Pricing depends on assigned storage class.

Glacier - Not technically a class, but a whole separate service.
Designed for long-term archival storage. May take several hours for objects stored in Glacier to be retrieved.
99.999999999% durability
Cheapest of all S3 classes.

Object durability - % over a one year time period where a file stored in S3 won't be lost.
11 nines = that there's a .000000009% chance of a file being lost in S3 in a year, or you may lose one file in 10 million years.
Done by making multiple replications of a file over the zones in a region.

Object availability - % over a one year time period that a file stored in S3 will be accessible.
.01% chance that you won't be able to access a file stored in S3 in a year.


Lifecycle policy - Set custom time tables from when an object will move from one storage class to another. Somewhat replaced by Intelligent tiering


Other Benefits and features of S3:
Object sharing - publicly available via a URL link
Object lifecycle
Object versioning - keep multiple versions of an object when enabled.
