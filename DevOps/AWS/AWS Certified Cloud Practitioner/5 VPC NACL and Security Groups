12. Security and VPC

What is a VPC?
Virtual Private Cloud - Private subsection of AWS you control in which you place AWS resources.
When an AWS account is created, a "default" VPC is also created and tied to that account automatically.

VPC is a network in a particular region.

NACL - firewall/security layer at the subnet level
SG - Security group: firewall/security layer on the instance/server level
