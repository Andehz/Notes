1. IAM Essentials
Where you manage access to AWS endpoints. Used to create users and assign permission policies to each service. Can get very fine grained.
Users can go into groups.

Roles are used to grant applications access to AWS services.

IAM API keys - associated with a user and permission policy. Must be provided when calls are made with API.

Can customize sign-in link so it can be easier to remember/more security because it won't use your account number as part of the domain prefix.

Security status box: Some quick recommendations to better secure account.

Account settings - can set strong password policies here.


By default, no password policy for account. Also no default groups and users. All of these must be created.
Users created by default have no permissions, implicit deny.

Everything done in IAM is done at the account level by default, permissions are done for all regions unless specified by conditions.

Not recommended to use root user for every day administration. Should create a daily driver admin user instead to do daily admin tasks.

Users should also not share user accounts. Everyone should have their own accounts.

Good practice to assign permission policies to group, then put users in those groups. Much more convenient.

ALWAYS follow the Principal of Least Privilege. Better to give too few, then make them ask for more.
