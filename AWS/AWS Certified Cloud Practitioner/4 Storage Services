10. Simple Storage Service (S3) and Glacier

S3 - An online bulk storage service that you can access from almost any device.

Can store any file type in S3.

Root level folders are known as buckets, subfolders are just folders.

Files are referred to as objects.

Buckets must select a specific region for it to exist in.

Best practice is to select region that's physically closest to you/target end user.

Rules to creating a bucket:
-name must be unique across the entirety of AWS.
-must be 3 to 63 characters in length.
-can only contain lowercase letters, number, and hyphens
-must not be formatted as an IP address

Storage class - classification assigned to each object in S3.

Glacier technically isn't a storage class, but commonly referred to as one.

Can change storage class on demand, except for Glacier. Glacier requires more set up.
