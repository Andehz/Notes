10. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS Regions - highest conceptual level, comprised of multiple availability zones, of multiple data centers

Availability zones - work together to make up a collection of your AWS resources. Properly designed apps will utilize multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
AZ's have direct low latency to each other and each one is isolated from others to ensure fault tolerance.
