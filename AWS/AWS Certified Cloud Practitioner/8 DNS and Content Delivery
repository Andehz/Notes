18. Route 53

Where you configure and manage web domains for websites or applications you host on AWS.

Performs three main functions:
Domain registration - lets you register domain names.
DNS service - Translates friendly domain names. Responds to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS servers, which reduces latency.
Health checking - Sends automated requests over the internet to your application to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional.

Multi-region failover - If Route 53 can't reach your application because maybe it failed catastrophically, can have route 53 reroute traffic to another region of a replicated version of that application.

19 CloudFront (Content delivery Network)

Allows you to store content at "edge location" located all around the world. Allows your customers to access your content more quickly and can also provide additional security - especially DDoS attacks

Edge location - like a region, but don't have all of the features of a regular AWS region/datacenter. Specifically designed to be a "front" for a user's content
Content can be hosted in one region, and content is hosted in edge locations all around the world. Essentially a cache for your content.
Edge locations work in conjuction with Lambda, CloudFront, Route 53, and other services.

CloudFront "Origin" - Location that holds your primary files and content. Users may never actually access the origin, hits an edge location instead. Good if hit by a DDoS attack.

Benefits to Route 53:
Domain registration
DNS services
Traffic flow (sends users to the best endpoint)
Health checking
Automatic DNS failvoer
Integrates with a variety of AWS services as endpoints

Benefits to CloudFront:
Cache content at edge locations for fast distribution to customers
Built-in DDoS attack protection
Integrates with many AWS services
