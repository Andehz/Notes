9. IAM - Identity and Access Management

Where and how AWS manages AWS accounts for users and the various resources.

Security, Identity, & Compliance > IAM

Common use of IAM:
-users
-groups
-access policies
-roles
-user credentials
-user password policies
-MFA
-API keys for CLI access


User accounts just created have no access to any services. All permissions must be "attached."

Three components for IAM user:
-User name
-password
-permissions to services


Company IT department responsible for attaching IAM permission policies for a particular user.

IAM groups
Add IAM users and can attach policy at the group level and the policy will be added to all the users under the group.

Can also have unique permissions per user level and group level.

Roles - How AWS services are granted permissions to communicate and share data.
Can't attach IAM policies to systems directly, ONLY users.
Attach a policy to the role, then the system can assume the role and take those permissions from there.

User password policies - password requirements for AWS accounts.

IAM is a global service, not by region.

ARN - Amazon resource name

Managed policy - policies attached by AWS or an admin. Changes to policies are immediately applied. It's shared for all members.

Inline policy - Policy for one user/group. Used for special cases.

Denies will always overrule a conflicting allow. Explicit deny.

AWS follows least privileges for permissions.
