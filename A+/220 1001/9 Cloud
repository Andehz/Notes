1. Cloud Models

IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
AKA Hardware as a Service. Outsource equipment, but still in charge of software. Web hosting providers are common IaaS

SaaS - Software as a Service
On-demand software. Gmail, Dayforce, etc. Central management of data and applications. No development work generally needed, vendor deals with that.

PaaS - Platform as a Service
No servers, no software, no maintenance needed. All underlying infrastructure is managed by a third party. You only need to worry about the application and developing it.


Cloud Deployment Models

Private Cloud - You own the virtualized local data center.
  No resources are shared.
  Build your own cloud.
  Pay for everything up front.
  No ongoing costs.

Public - Available to everyone over the internet
  Share resources with a public cloud
  Underlying infrastructure owned by a third party.
  Cost may be metered/up-front

Hybrid - Mix of public and private

Community - Several organizations share the same resources

2. Virtualization

Virtualization - Native operating system. Perform OS processes natively

Emulation - run software designed for a different architecture. Different architecture is translated to run on the native OS. Much slower than virtualization generally.


Security
Although there's no known significant vulnerabilities yet, doesn't mean there aren't any.

VM escaping - Malware recognizes it's on a VM, malware compromises hypervisor, malware jumps between different VMs.

Guest Operating System security should be treated just like as if it was a regular computer.

Watch out for rogue VMs.


Network Requirements

Shared network address - VM shares same IP as physical host. IP is NAT'd to convert to physical host IP.

Bridged network address - VM is a device on physical network.

Private network addressing - VM cannot access outside the virtual network.
