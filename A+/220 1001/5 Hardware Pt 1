1. Copper Network Cables
Cables are fundamental to your network. Bad cables = bad times!

Twisted pair cabling
Balanced pair operations - two wires with equal and opposite signals. One +, One -

The twist keeps a single wire constantly moving away from interference. Opposite signals are compared on the other end.
Pairs on the same cables have different twist rates. Helps make sure traffic gets through network even with interference.

Network Cabling standards

EIA - Alliance of trade associations, develops standards for the industry.
Electronics Industries Alliance. RS-#.

TIA - Telecommunications Industry Association.
Standards, market analysis, etc. ANSI/TIA/EIA-568 - Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard

International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
Defines classes of networking standards.

Cable Categories
Cat 3 - 10BASE-T, 100meters
Cat 5 - 100BASE-TX 1000BASE-T, 100meters
Cat 5e - 100BASE-TX 1000BASE-T, 100meters
Cat 6 - 10GBASE-T, 37 - 55 meters
Cat 6A - 10GBASE-T, 100meters


Plenum - shared area above work space for HVAC. Concerns of smoke/fire so make sure you have the right cabling.

PVC - Polyvinyl chloride. Traditional cable jacket.

FEP - Fluorinated ethylene polymer, or low smoke PVC are good for plenum. May not be as flexible as regular cable/ not the same bend radius.

Plan for worst-case scenario.


Cabling types
UTP - Unshielded twisted pair. No additional shielding, just  the PVC.

STP - Shielded twisted pair. Additional shielding protects against interference. Shield each pair and/or the overall cable. Requires cable to be grounded.

Abbreviations
U = Unshielded
S = Braided shielding
F = Foil shielding

S/FTP - Braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around pairs.
F/UTP - Foil around the  cable and no shielding around the pairs.


T568A/T568B Termination
Pin assignments for how cables get terminated. Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling.

A and B are different pin assignments for 8P8C connectors.

T568A - use this for horizontal cabling.
T568B - most cabling use this one regardless, less confusion.

Can't mix and match the two standards.

(Know the termination standards and what they are!)


Coaxial cable
Two or more forms share a common axis.

RG-6 used in television/digital cable.
RG-59 used as patch cables. Not designed for long distance communications.

------------------------
2. Fiber Network Cables
Transmit data by light. No RF signal, very difficult to monitor to tap.

Signal is slow to degrade, so can go over very long distances. Immune to RF and interference.

MMF - Multimode fiber
Light comes out into modes on the other side. Good for short-range communications.
Up to 2km for 100Mbit/s, 550m for 10Gbit/s. Inexpensive light source.

SMG - Single mode fiber.
Light comes out in one mode. Good for long-range communications.
Can go up to 80km without additional processing. May take an expensive light source like laser beams.

----------------
3. Video Cables

VGA - Video graphics array
AKA, DB-15 connector/DE-15. Usually colored blue due to PC System Design Guide.
Analog signal, no digital option, image degrades after 5 to 10 meters.

PC System Design Guide - Convention in how connectors need to be colored.


HDMI - High-Definition Multimedia Interface.
Audio and video stream. All digital, no analog. 20m distance before losing too much signal.
19-pin connectorm proprietary.

miniHDMI - Type-C connector.


DisplayPort
Standard created by VESA. Royalty-free standard. Data is sent in packetized form like ethernet and PCI-e.
Can use a passive adapter to convert between HDMI and DVI.


DVI - Digital Visual Interface
Single link - 3.7 Gbps. HDTV @ 60fps
Dual link - 7.4Gbps. HDTV @ 85fps

DVI-A: Analog signals
DVI-D: Digital signals
DVI-I: Integrated. Supports both.

-------------------------
4. Multipurpose Cables

Thunderbolt
High-speed serial connection. Data and power on same cable. Based on MDP (Mini DisplayPort) standard.

v1 - two channels, 10Gbit per channels. 20Gbit/s total throughput. MDP connector.
v2 - 20Gbit/s aggregated channels. MDP connector
v3 - 40Gbit/s, USB-C connector. Max 3m copper, 60m optical, daisy chain up to 6 devices.


USB
Intended to simplify connections.

USB1.1
  low-speed: 1.5mbit/s, 3m
  Full-speed: 12mbit/s, 5m

USB2.0 - 480mbit/s, 5m

USB3.0 - SuperSpeed, 5Gbit/s, 3m. Standard doesn't specify a cable length though.
Has no mini/micro usb connector for the standard.

USB3.1 - Released Jul 2013, SS+, Type-A/C connectors. 10Gbit/s

USB3.2 - Sep 2017. New SS+ over usb-c. 10Gbit/s and 20Gbit/s

USB-C - Connector works either way, different than previous USB connectors.
USB doesn't necessarily mean it's USB3.1 ready. Cable must support it. Must support > 7.5w output, 3.1 speeds, and alternate mode (lets you send other protocols through the cable)
About the same size as micro b.


DB-9 serial cable connector.
D-subminiature B or D-sub. Different sizes A through E.
Commonly used for RS-232, Recommended standard 232. Industry standard since 1969. Commonly used for management/console port.

----------------------------
5. SATA Drive Cables
Common way to connect storage devices.

Serial-AT Attachment.

SATA 1.0 - 1.5Gbit/s, up to 1meter.
SATA 2.0 - 3.0Gbit/s, up to 1meter.
SATA 3.0 - 6Gbit/s, up to 1meter.
SATA 3.2 -  16Gbit/s, up to 1meter.

15 pins = power, 7pin = data.

------------------------------
6. PATA Drive Cables
Not the most recent type of storage, some legacy systems still use it.

Parallel AT Attachment. From 1999. Originally called IDE - Integrated Drive Electronics.
From 16MB/S to 133MB/s. Let you connect peripherals like CD-ROM.
Changed from IDE to PATA once SATA was release to help differentiate the two. Uses a 40wire/80wire cable.

From closest to farthest on the cable:
  40wire - Device 0 (master), Device 1 (slave)
  80wire - Device 1 (slave), device 0 (master)

Can only support up to two drives per cable, need more cables to support more drives.
80 wire extra cables are grounding wires to reduce crosstalk.

----------------------------
7. SCSI Cables
Small Computer Systems Interface. Originally designed to string many peripherals together onto a single cable/controller. Up to 16 devices in a daisy chain.
Many different parallel and serial solutions. Used to be how people connect a bunch of devices.

Many devices on a bus: 8 on narrow, 16 on wide bus.

SCSI didn't need a lot of configing. Assign a number and let SCSI do the rest.

Still used in enterprise today, well supported.

SCSI ID = controller, ID 2 = usually hard drive, ID3 = usually cd-rom.

LUN - Logical unit number. Separate drives in a storage array or VM.

Use a terminator to signal the "end" of bus.

SAS - Serial attached SCSI. Newer form of SCSI, devices have no jumpers, terminators, or other settings.
Increased throughput, this is a point-to-point connection. No more daisy chains. No termination needed.

--------------------------------
8. Adapters and Converters
Allow you to convert from one connector to another as long as they're electrically compatible. If not, may need to use a converter.

DVI to VGA backward compatible with VGA, but only up to 640 x 480.
