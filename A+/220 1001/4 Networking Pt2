1. 802.11 Wireless Standards
Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN committee. Many updates over time. Wi-Fi Alliance handles interoperability testing.

802.11a - October 1999.
Operates 5GHz range. 54.Mbit/s, smaller range than 802.11b.
Not used that much today.

802.11b - October 1999
Also an original standard.
Operates at 2.4GHz range. 11Mbit/s, better range than 802.11a. More frequency conflicts as many other devices used the same frequencies.

802.11g - June 2003
Operates in the 2.4GHz range.
54Mbit/s. Backwards-compatible with 802.11b. Same issues as 802.11b

802.11n - October 2009.
Update to all the previous standards. Operates at 5GHz/2.4GHz and 40MHz width channels.
600Mbit/s when used in 40MHz mode and 4 antennas. Uses MIMO - Multiple-input Multiple Output. Multiple transmit and receive antennas.

802.11ac - Jan 2014
Significant improvements over 802.11n.
Operates exclusively over 5 GHz. Increased channel bonding, larger bandwidth usage. Denser signal modulation, 8 MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO) streams
Nearly 7Gbits/s theoretically. (866.7Mbit/s per stream)

2. Wireless Network Technologies
Two major frequencies used when using WiFi. 2.4/5GHz

Channels - Grouping of frequencies, numbered of IEEE.

Bandwidth - amount of frequency in use
20, 40, 80, 120MHz blocks

802.11a - 20MHz bandwidth
802.11b - 22MHz bandwidth
802.11g - 20MHz
802.11n - 20 or 40MHz, two contiguous bonded channels. In 2.4GHz, 40MHz channel uses much of the available bandwidth.
802.11ac - 40MHz for 802.11n stations, 80MHz 802.11ac stations needed. 160MHz optional.

2.4GHz - Channel 1, 6, 11.
5GHz - significantly more.

Bluetooth
High speed communication over short distances. PAN that connects a bunch of our mobile devices.

RFID - Radio-frequency identification.
Used everywhere for identification. Uses radio technology. NFC is a form of RFID.

Two IoT standards:
  Zigbee - Open standard 802.15.4 PAN.
    Alternative to WiFi and bluetooth. Longer distances than bluetooth, less power consumption than wifi.
    Mesh network, uses the ISM band 900Mhz and 2.4Ghz frequencies in the US.

  Z-Wave - Proprietary home automation networking. Wireless mesh networking, uses ISM band's 900MHz and 2.4GHz frequencies.

3. Cellular Network Technologies
Cell phones called that way because we separate land into cells, antenna covers a cell with certain frequencies.

2G Networks
Built for voice communication in mind, not originally designed to send data.
  GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications
  CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access

3G Networks
Introduced in 1998. Upgraded data connectivity over 2G. Significant bandwidth improvements.

4G and LTE - Long Term Evolution
Converged standard, based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced data rates for GSM Evolution)
Supports DL rates of 150Mbits/s

LTE-A - LTE Advanced
Standard supports download rates of 300Mbit/s

5G
Update to 4G. Rollout in late 2018 and 2019. Worldwide launches in 2020.
Significant performance improvements.
