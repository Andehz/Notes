15. Cloning local repos.
Clone repositories if you don't want to mess with the master branch.

git clone <source repo> <new repo>

Good to do if you want to work on features and don't want to mess anything up on important branches.

Use the -local switch so clones reference local repos as the reference and not the remote repo that the original came from.

16. Cloning repos over HTTPS

#Clones a remote git repo to the local fs.
git clone <remote URL>

Gets the git database as well, including history.

17. Forking

More of a process than a command. Consider it a series of commands if done from the terminal.

May want to create a new project based on another.
