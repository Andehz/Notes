18. Tracking Remote Repos.

#Shows remote servers that are being tracked f or the current repo.
git remote -v

#Fetches new commit information down from the remote server for the current repository.
#Doesn't commit anything to the local db.
git fetch <remote>

Fetched changes aren't part of the local repo automatically till merged.

#Shows info from origin
git remote show origin

#Automatically pulls down any changes.
git pull

19. Pushing to remote repos.

Considered bad form to push to master to projects you don't control.

#Pushes changes to a remote repo. -u ensure tracking of the upstream reference.
git push -u <remote> <local branch>
