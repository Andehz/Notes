1. Install packages:
yum install sssd realmd oddjob oddjob-mkhomedir adcli samba-common samba-common-tools krb5-workstation openldap-clients policycoreutils-python -y

2. Configure hosts file to be able to resolve the FQDN for the AD domain.
vim /etc/resolv.conf

3. Join to the domain using an elevated account that will let you in.
realm join --user=<domain user> dcname.domain.com

4. Verify domain information
realm list

5. Verify ability to access user directory by querying for a user in AD.
id user@domain.com (UPN)


Notes:
Check system time if you're unable to join the domain and everything looks ok, make sure it's within the 5 minute limit for Kerberos.
