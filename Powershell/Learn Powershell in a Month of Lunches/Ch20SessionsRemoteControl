Sessions: Remote Control with Less Work


There are other, more reusable ways to remotely connect to a PC: reusable sessions.



Creating and using reusable sessions
---------------------------------------------------

Session - persistent connection between local instance of PoSh and a remote copy of PoSh.

New-PSSession - Creates a new session.
PS C:\> new-pssession -computername server-r2,server17,dc5

To retrieve sessions, use get-pssession

Closing shell will automatically close session. Can also use remove-pssession to close a session.

Close all sessions:
    get-pssession | remove-pssession

Remember that remoting must be enabled on a server before you can remotely access it.

Special syntax for saving multiple variables for multiple remote sessions:
    $s_server1,$s_server2 = new-pssession -computer server-r2,dc01

    server-r2 SHOULD goes into $s_server1, and dc01 goes into $s_server2. Order may change so please double check.


Using Sessions with Enter-PSSession
---------------------------------------------------

Enter-PSSession only lets you remote into a single PC. If you have an object with multiple sessions, you must specify which one you're using.
    PS C:\> enter-pssession -session $sessions[0]

Exit-PSSession to exit the session.

More elegant way of accessing an active session:
Get-PSSession -ComputerName SERVER-R2 | Enter-PSSession



Using Sessions with Invoke-Command
---------------------------------------------------

Remoting works over a single-predefined port; WMI doesn't. Remoting is easier to use with firewalled pcs.

Invoke-Command can't retrieve sessions from pipeline.



Implicit Remoting: Importing a Session
---------------------------------------------------

Import-PSSession -session $session -module activedirectory -prefix rem

Imported PSSession data is deserialized.



Using Disconnnected Sessions
---------------------------------------------------

Disconnect-PSSession -Id 4

Disconnects session on remote PC, but keeps powershell running on that computer. Be careful not to leave a bunch of active PoSh sessions switching around.

However, if you Get-PSSession on yet another pc into the disconnected PC, you can see that disconnected session and jump back into it as long as you're the right user.
