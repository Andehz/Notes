Scripts work similarly to batch files. 

Highlight a portion of script and press F8 to run just that portion of the script in ISE.


` = tells PoSh that next line is part of the same command.

param($computername ='localhost') = Constructor to run $computername='localhost' as the default variable.

Can specify paramater like you would any other parameter in a custom cmdlet.



Documenting your Script
---------------------------------------------------

Use # per line to comment it, or <# <script body> #> to comment out a block.

In comments, can specify the following to populate help:
    .SYNOPSIS
    summary of what cmdlet does.

    .DESCRIPTION
    detailed explainaition of cmdlet.

    .PARAMETER <paramater>
    specify what a particular parameter does.

    .EXAMPLE
    Give an example of cmdlet in action.

This must appear at the beginning at your cmdlet.



One Script, One Pipeline
---------------------------------------------------

Cmdlets placed in the same script will go through same pipeline.

Look at executing Get-Process and Get-Service in shell vs executing them at once in ISE.

Only one pipeline to work with in a script.



A Quick Look at Scope
---------------------------------------------------

Global scope = script itself

Script scope = new scope created when a script is run. Subsidiary to global scope, child of global.

Scope lasts only as long as needed to run whatever is in that scope.
Once it stops running, scope vanishes, taking everything in it with it.

PowerShell looks for scope by expanding outward from current scope. 
If it doesn't find variable in current scope, it expands to next parent scope till it does find one.

Locally defined versions of a variable lose access to parent scope's version.
