Using the Help System


"If you aren’t willing to read PowerShell’s help files, you won’t be effective with PowerShell. You won’t learn how to use it, you won’t learn how to administer products like Windows with it, and you might as well stick with the GUI."

update-help - Updates PowerShell help files
  -source: lets you specify where to update help files, either locally or remotely.

Save-Help - saves help files in specified location for future use, ie.; update help files on a computer that isn't connected to the internet.

Help - like Get-Help but pipes the help output to the More command, which paginates the view.

NOTE: More command doesn't work in ISE.

-----------------------------------
Using help to find commands

-Name parameter is a positional parameter for the help command, so you don't need to specify it when using Help.
Also accepts wildcards like *. eg.; help *log*, help *event*

help *log* returns a list of commands that have log somewhere in the name of the command.

* - stands for zero or more characters.

Using a parameter-set specific parameter "locks" you into that specific set of parameters.

[<CommonParameters>] - set of eight parameters that are available to every single cmdlet.

--------------------------------------
Optional and mandatory parameters

[-ComputerName] - Brackets mean that a parameter is optional

Only need to type in enough of a parameter so there's no ambiguity.

Parameters that aren't enclosed in brackets are mandatory. Either PowerShell will prompt you for the parameter when you execute it without it, or it'll error out.

-------------------------
Positional parameters

Parameters that only need to be specified based on positioning in cmdlet. Doesn't need to explicitly invoked.

ex: [-LogName] <string> [[-InstanceId] <Int64[]>]


Specifying -LogName is optional, but the -LogName parameter itself is mandatory as indicated by the fact that the valuetype isn't in brackets

Positional parameters must always be in the correct position. Always legal to specify parameter names though.

It's probably best practice to explicitly define parameters with their full names though, will be hard to remember commands six months from now!

help get-eventlog -full : the full parameter outputs an even more detailed help screen and info about each parameter.

  -showwindow outputs -full in a gui pop up window when GUI abilties are available.

---------------------------
Parameter values

Switches: Parameters don't take in a value, but will perform something when it's invoked, eg.; [-AsString]. These are never positional.


Common input types:
  Strings: Series of letters and numbers
  Int/Int32/Int64: An integer
  DateTime: String that can be interpreted as a date based on a PC's regional settings. eg.; 10-10-2010

Legal way of specifying arrays in a parameter:
  Examples:
  Get-EventLog Security -computer Server-R2

  Get-EventLog Security -computer Server-R2,DC4,Files02

  Get-EventLog Security -computer 'Server-R2','Files02'

  Get-EventLog Application -computer (Get-Content names.txt)
    Have text file input one value per line.
    Server-R2
    Files02
    Files03
    DC04
    DC03

() force Powershell to run a particular command first. The preceding command tells powershell to run Get-Content first to get the appropriate data before executing the -computer paremeter.

Pressing Enter on a blank prompt will tell PowerShell to stop prompting and execute based on previous inputs.

help doesn't paginate in ISE.
------------------------------------------
Finding command examples

Help get-eventlog -example : PowerShell displays common usage examples of particular command when available.

summary help - short description of what the command does.

parameter sets - ways in how to handle a command. Commands work in sets. If it appears in one set and not the other, it'll only work in that set.
They're mutually exclusive. No mix and matching. Running parameters that exist in both sets means PoSH will run the first one.

Positional parameters must always be in the correct position when not specifying parameter name.

Switches are never positional values.

Single quotes are better than double for string inputs.

----------------------------
Accessing "about" topics

Filesnames that start with about_. These have background information based on the topic it's about.
ex.; Help about_common_parameters

----------------------------
Accessing online help

Help get-eventlog -online

Get online documentation with -online switch. Opens default browser to relevant link. Often more up to date than built in documentation

--------------------------
Misc notes

Cmdlets named via singular nouns, not plural.

-------------------------------
Useful commands:

Get-Content: read in data from another source.
