Understanding how filesystem is organized

Windows filesystem is organized around three object types: drives, folders, and files.

  Drives - top-level object, contain both folders and files.
  Folders - Kind of container, can contain files and other Folders
  Files -  Not a container, more of an endpoint object.


Files and folders in Powershell are referred to as items.


Items can have properties.

Normal verbs can apply to items. ItemProperty noun refers to attributes of an item. ChildItem refers to items contained with an item, like a folder


Some cmdlets don't work with some providers. Refer to documentation in what works where.


set-location - Change the shell's current location to a different container-type item, like a folder.

-------------------------------------------
Using wildcards and literal paths


Most item cmdlets include a -Path property, and by default the property accepts wildcards.

* - zero or more chars

? - Any single digit character

-LiteralPath parameter - Specifies path but wildcards are treated as regular characters Instead



------------------------------------
Other

New-Item - creates a new generic item. Must specify a type.
