-----------------------------
Cmdlet naming convention

Cmdlet - Native PowerShell command-line utility. Exist only inside PowerShell and are written in a .NET Framework language like C#.

Function - similar to a cmdlet but rather than written in a .Net language, they're written in PowerShell's own scripting language.

Workflow - special kind of function that ties into PowerShell's workflow execution system

Application - any kind of external executable, including command-line utilities like ping.


Names start with a standard verb like Get, Set, New, or Pause. After, followed by a dash, then a singular noun.

eg.; Set-ADUser


------------------------------
Aliases: nicknames for commands

Alias - A nickname for a command that PowerShell recognizes.

To find aliases for some cmdlets:

get-alias -Definition "Get-Service"

Output:

Capability Name
---------- ----
Cmdlet     gsv -> Get-Service



The Help command will always display the full command name for an alias.


Custom aliases:

New-Alias: create custom aliases
Export-Alias: Export a list of aliases
Import-Alias: Import a list of previously created aliases

Aliases by default only last as long as the current session they were created in. Once PowerShell closes, the alias is gone. Hence why you should export and import.

NOTE: Aliases cannot come bundled with parameters, only the cmdlet itself.


Parameters can also have aliases, but they can be hard to find. Use the following example to see how to find aliases for parameters:

PS C:\> (get-command get-eventlog | select -ExpandProperty parameters) .computername.aliases


Show-Command: Delivers a graphical UI to help show available parameters for a particular command.


PowerShell can also execute Cmd.exe-native commands as well, like ping. It'll execute a cmd shell behind the scenes to get the info you need.

& - Invocation character to get PowerShell to run an external command more cleanly. Sometimes the native PowerShell parser just doesn't cut it.
