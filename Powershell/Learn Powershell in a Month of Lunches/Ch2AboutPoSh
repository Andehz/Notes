Good idea to jack up font size a bit as small characters can be easily missed.

Configure PowerShell so there's no horizontal scrollbars for outputs. This can be a source of some massive frustration.

Always run PowerShell as Administrator if you want to get full use of it. Not always recommended if you're running it in a production environment though.


$PSVersionTable - tells you what version of PowerShell you're running.
