Adding commands

All about extensibility. Yo. Like MMC but for scripting. Product-specific shell shortcuts are still the same powershell. Not limited to a single product!

Snapins are like modules, but require DLLs. Microsoft moving away from them.
Modular management tools. One shell can open multiple.



get-pssnapin -registered : tells us what snapins are available and installed.

add-pssnapin sqlservercmdletsnapin100 : Loads a snapin. In this case, sqlservercmdletsnapin100


gcm (Get-Command)

gcm -pssnapin sqlservercmdletsnapin100 : Lists what commands a snapin has added to PoSh


Snapins may add new providers as well.


--------------------
Modules

Similar to snapins, but designed to be more self-contained and somewhat easier to distribute.

Don't require advanced registration, PoSh automatically looks in a certain set of paths to find them.

PSModulePath - Defines paths where PoSh expects modules to live. Windows environment variable.
get-content env:PSModulePath

get-module : returns modules loaded in PoSh

remove-module : removes modules loaded.

Import-Module : imports a module via path if it hasn't been auto-loaded.

PowerShell modules with same cmdlet names have the last loaded cmdlet run. To specify another version use:
<module>\<cmdlet>, eg.; MyCoolSnapin\Get-User

-----------------------
Export-Console [-Path] : Export PoSh console with snapins so you don't need to manually load them all again next time.
