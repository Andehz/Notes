Input and Output


Prompting for, and displaying, information
---------------------------------------------------

console host - command-line console you see when running powershell.exe

You interact with the hosting application, and it passes your commands through to the engine.


Write-Host
---------------------------------------------------

Read-Host - cmdlet designed to display tempt prompt and then collect text input from user.

Use Write-Verbose to output status messages and general messaging to user over Write-Host.
Must manually enable Write-Verbose to console in order to see any output.
    $VerbosePreference = "Continue" - Enables Write-Verbose
    $Verbose-Preference = "SilentlyContinue" - Surpress output.


Write-Host output can't be captured. If a script is run remotely or unnattended, this could be an issue.

Write-host bypasses pipeline and writes directly to the hosting applications display.


Write-Output
---------------------------------------------------

Write-Output can send objects into the pipeline. Shell's default cmdlet.


Other Ways to Write
---------------------------------------------------

These other cmdlets work like write-host, don't put anything into pipeline and output directly.

    Write-Warning - Displays warning text, in yellow by default.
        $WarningPreference = Set to Continue by default.
    
    Write-Verbose - Displays additional informative text, yellow by default.

    Write-Debuug - Displays a debugging text, in yellow by default.
        $DebugPreference - SilentlyContinue bu default.
