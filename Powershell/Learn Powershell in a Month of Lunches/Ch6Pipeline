The pipeline: connecting commands

Pipeline - a way for one command to pass/pipe its output to another command.

get-process | Export-csv procs.csv - exports process data to csv file.
Note the #. This identifies what kind of info that was exported to the csv file from PoSh.

Import-csv procs.csv - imports a csv into powershell.

Export-clixml - create a generic CLI XML file. Unique to powershell, but any XML reader can read it.


Diff -reference (Import-CliXML reference.xml) -difference (Get-Process) -property Name
Diff is an alias for compare-object. Designed to take two sets of info and compare them to each other.

Get-Service | ConvertTo-HTML | Out-File services.html

> is basically piped out-file cmdlet under the hood. eg.; dir | Out-file DirectoryList.txt.

Out-Default - Default output type PoSh uses when an Out- cmdlet isn't specified. eg.; running dir is the same as running dir | Out-Default

Out-gridview - fancy UI output. Needs PoSH ISE and .NET framework v3.5

ConvertTo- commands don't save, only output in their respective formats. Keep this in mind.

----------------------------------------
6.5 Using cmdlets that modify the System

Cmdlets that modify the system in some way have a preset impact level mandated by PoSh devs. These levels can't be changed.

$confirmpreference - cmdlets that are at this impact level will prompt a confirmation message when running in PoSh.
Use -confirm switch to automatically ok prompt.

get-content only reads in text file and PoSH doesn't try to parse or interpret data in any way. 
    Note the noticeable formatting differences between import-csv and get-content

Import commands pays attention to formatting in PoSh.
