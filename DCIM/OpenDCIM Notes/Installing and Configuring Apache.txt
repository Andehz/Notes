----------------------
Installing and Starting Apache Web Server

Easy to install because it's in the default repos.

1. sudo yum install httpd

Set service to start at boot.
2. systemctl enable httpd

3. Start the service (not on by default)
systemctl start httpd

Check errors in httpd. Check here if errors in the install for Apache.
sudo /var/log/httpd/error_log

4. Disable SELinux

Check SELinux status. Do temporarily to prevent install conflicts.
sestatus

setenforce 0

Look for status:
Current mode:                   permissive

5. Install httpd documentation. Review this to learn how to do basically anything in Apache.

sudo yum install httpd-manual

6. Restart Apache as documentation does make config changes.
sudo systemctl restart httpd

------------------------------
Basic Apache Config

Config file location: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Document root directive in httpd.conf: tells apache what's the root directory for web content

User/group apache: the service account used by apache to control permissions for apache.

Container directives - directives apache perform if apache serves a file specified within a container.

DirectoryIndex

--------------------------------
Virtual Hosting

Method for hosting multiple domain names on a single servers. Single installation of Apache can serve all of the sites.

Name-based virtual hosting - All sites resolve to the same IP address. Apache separates requests to appropriate sites.

ServerName = Name of site

DocumentRoot = Root of site.

Once a virtual host is created, default host must be redefined explicitly as a virtual host.
