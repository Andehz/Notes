The command:

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mysqldump/

The mysqldump client is a backup program originally written by Igor Romanenko. It can be used to dump a database or a collection of databases for backup or transfer to another database server (not necessarily MariaDB or MySQL). The dump typically contains SQL statements to create the table, populate it, or both. 
However, mysqldump can also be used to generate files in CSV, other delimited text, or XML format.

If you are doing a backup on the server and your tables all are MyISAM tables, consider using mysqlhotcopy instead because it can accomplish faster backups and faster restores.

mysqldump dumps triggers along with tables, as these are part of the table definition. 
However, stored procedures, views, and events are not, and need extra parameters to be recreated explicitly (for example, --routines and --events). 
Procedures and functions are however also part of the system tables (for example mysql.proc).



Making backups:

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/making-backups-with-mysqldump/

One of the best utilities to use to make a backup copy of a server's MariaDB's data is mysqldump. It comes with MariaDB, so it costs you nothing more. Best of all it doesn't require you to shut down MariaDB services to make a backup. 
It works very simply: it retrieves the data and schema from each database and table and builds a data text file outside of MariaDB. This data text file (known as a dump file) will contain the SQL statements necessary to reconstruct the databases and data. 
If you were to open a dump file generated by mysqldump, you would see CREATE TABLE statements and a multitude of INSERT statements, one for each row of data.



Restoring:

https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/restoring-data-from-dump-files/

If you lose your data in MariaDB, but have been using mysqldump to make regular backups of your data in MariaDB, you can use the dump files to restore your data. This is the point of the back-ups, after all. 
To restore a dump file, it's just a matter of having the mysql client execute all of the SQL statements that the file contains. 
There are some things to consider before restoring from a dump file, so read this section all of the way through before restoring. 
One simple and perhaps clumsy method to restore from a dump file is to enter something like the following:

mysql --user admin_restore --password < /data/backup/db1.sql
Again, this is not using mysqldump. The mysqldump utility is only for making back-up copies, not restoring databases. 
Instead, you would use the mysql client, which will read the dump file's content in order to batch execute the SQL statements that it contains.




[Terminology]


db schema - 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema

the database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed 
(divided into database tables in the case of relational databases).


http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1216889&seqNum=2
A schema is a collection of database objects (as far as this hour is concerned—tables) associated with one particular database username. This username is called the schema owner, or the owner of the related group of objects.

Go over SQL/database basics. Going to want this in case something goes wrong on the install and we need to troubleshoot.
