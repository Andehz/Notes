Copy db.inc.php-dist to db.inc.php and modify as needed for your site.
It is not a good idea to just copy the version from the previous version because sometimes configuration directives in this file are added.
If you copied an old version you wouldn't have that.


What a .dist file does:

1. Move to new directory of install.
cd /opt/openDCIM/opendcim1901/openDCIM-19.01

2. Create new db access file from .dist
cp db.inc.php-dist db.inc.php


3. Change ownership of all files to apache.

sudo chown -R apache:apache openDCIM-19.01


4. Set permissions to 7775

sudo cmod -R 7775 openDCIM-19.01/


5. Edit new db access file.
vim db.inc.php


6. Edit to these settings in the following lines in db.inc.php.
 $devMode =="FALSE"
 $dbhost = 'localhost';
 $dbname = 'dcim';
 $dbuser = 'dcim';
 $dbpass = 'dcim';
