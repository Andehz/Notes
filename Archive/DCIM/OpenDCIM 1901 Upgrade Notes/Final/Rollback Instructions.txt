If installation to new version doesn't work, use these to fall back to an older version.

1. Navigate to openDCIM directory

cd /opt/openDCIM



2. Change symlink reference to older build.

sudo ln -snf opendcim1801bak opendcim



3. Restart Apache.

sudo systemctl restart httpd



NOTE: Many installation directives write directly to the database (fac_Config)
Even if you roll back, many of the sites settings won't change back to any configuration settings from older builds.
You may see it listed as 19.01 even though you're running an older version of openDCIM.
This is fine and only a topical error. As long as the database is fine then there should be no issues.

Recommended that the database be backed up so any future changes to OpenDCIM that destructively alter the database don't cause issues with older versions of OpenDCIM.
