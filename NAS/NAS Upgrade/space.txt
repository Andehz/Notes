Each ESX host has two drives. One SSD for VMs, other is spinning disk for general data. Should not use these for backups.
Need more disks!!!

We'll want to create the NAS first before going ahead for backup purposes.
Will want about 12TB total.

Expandibility. This is for future use.

NAS project:

1. Scope out net for recommendations, compile parts list.


Buy NAS case, or use old AZZA case? How many bays does AZZA case have?

Maybe just a hot swap cage instead? Wait for Ebay offer before going down this route.

Will want "NAS" quality drives. No cheap drives. Buy cheap, buy it twice.

May want to wait for a sale. 
WD Easystores frequently go on sale. Will want 8TB models. Get two of them? Shuck
