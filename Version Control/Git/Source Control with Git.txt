1. Basics of Git File system

.git file is created in a working directory that contains metadata about a repository. Database in .git file has info about files being tracked.

Files in git are untracked and unknown to git until they're added to git to be tracked.

Files in .git

COMMIT_EDITMSG - records of each commit in github

HEAD - Current branch being worked on.

Config - Contains config info about a repository, like email and user info.

Description - Txt file that contains name of repository. Typically used by gitweb

hooks - Contains scripts that can be used to create automated task.

index - Keeps tracks of items in the staging area and files ready to be committed.

info - Contains items like the excludefile.

logs - Contains log info of github

objects - database consists of compressed files that are hashed versions of content that have been commited in the repo. Index is the link to this.

refs - Contains references and tags for your repo.

2. Creating a local Empty Repository

git init <Name of Repo>

#creates a bare repo. Used for larger projects when multiple people are contributing with different branches.
git init --bare <Name of Repo.>


--------------------------------
3. Basic Config of Git

#Creates identity. Not authentication, just identifies who you are. In key:value pair form. This is mandatory.
git config --global user.email <email>
git config --global user.name <Name>

#Lists git config settings
git conig --list

You can change identity per repo by changing the working directory to that repo and initializing an identity without the global switch.
If git finds multiple entries of an item in the config, it'll use the last one in the config.


-----------------------------------
4. Add Files to a Project

#See what has been added into git. Can also do git status which is much cleaner.
cat .git/index

Git doesn't care about directories. If you want git to track a directory, create a .keep file in the target directory and add that .keep file to git.
