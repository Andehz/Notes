1. Basics of Git File system

.git file is created in a working directory that contains metadata about a repository. Database in .git file has info about files being tracked.

Files in git are untracked and unknown to git until they're added to git to be tracked.

Files in .git

COMMIT_EDITMSG - records of each commit in github

HEAD - Current branch being worked on.

Config - Contains config info about a repository, like email and user info.

Description - Txt file that contains name of repository. Typically used by gitweb

hooks - Contains scripts that can be used to create automated task.

index - Keeps tracks of items in the staging area and files ready to be committed.

info - Contains items like the excludefile.

logs - Contains log info of github

objects - database consists of compressed files that are hashed versions of content that have been commited in the repo. Index is the link to this.

refs - Contains references and tags for your repo.

If you're never sure, just use the man pages! man git-<command>

-------------------------------
2. Creating a local Empty Repository

git init <Name of Repo>

#creates a bare repo. Used for larger projects when multiple people are contributing with different branches.
git init --bare <Name of Repo.>


--------------------------------
3. Basic Config of Git

#Creates identity. Not authentication, just identifies who you are. In key:value pair form. This is mandatory.
git config --global user.email <email>
git config --global user.name <Name>

#Lists git config settings
git conig --list

You can change identity per repo by changing the working directory to that repo and initializing an identity without the global switch.
If git finds multiple entries of an item in the config, it'll use the last one in the config.


-----------------------------------
4. Add Files to a Project

#See what has been added into git. Can also do git status which is much cleaner.
cat .git/index

Git doesn't care about directories. If you want git to track a directory, create a .keep file in the target directory and add that .keep file to git.

---------------------------------
5. Status of your Project

#Abbreviated form of output. s = short
git status -s

Characters to the left of the output:
A = Added to Index
?? = Not yet added.
AM = Added and modified.

First character = staged value, second character = unstaged value. Must be re-added if you want to commit modified files that have changes after it's been added.


----------------------------------
6. Committing to Git.

#Commits files. Won't commit anything that hasn't been added.
git commit

Git commit messages are in a COMMIT_EDITMSG file.

commit 19e793becd9ad1c68283330977629e82dabc4be9
Author: newproject <newproject@email.com>
Date:   Mon May 6 09:33:39 2019 +0000

    Helo world!

Note the string next to commit is the SHA-1 has value. Git will also create a directory named after the first two characters of the value in the objects directory.
File in this directory is the contents in hashed form.

#removes file from git, but keeps it in the directory.
git rm --cache CHANGELOG.md

#Must commit after deletion
git commit -m "Deleted changelog from git"

#Commits file that was just changed without needing to add and commit seperately.
git commit -am "Readding changelog"


------------------------------------
7. Ignoring certain files.

Standard convention is to create a .gitignore file to exclude files from tracking by git. Can also edit exclude file directory too though. .git/info/exclude

Add the .gitignore file to root of repo.

Files edited in VIM are automatically backed up. These files end with a ~ character. May be wise to ignore these files. (*~ for all of these files.)

Returns files that have been ignored based on the specified pattern.
git check-ignore <pattern>


---------------------------------------
8. Tagging in git

Marks a particular commit if needed.

#create an annotated tag.
git tag -a <tag name> -m <message>

#Shows tag information
git tag

#shows info about a particular tag
git show <tag name>

Annotated tags are for more significant milestones. Lightweight tags are meant to be more temporary.

#Create a lightweight tag. Note that there's no -a
git tag <tag name>

#deletes a tag
git tag -d <tag name>




-------------------------------------
9. Using Branches

Master branch created by default when creating a new repo.

Making branches doesn't automatically set them as the working branch. HEAD is a pointer to which branch you are on.

#Shows last branch you were in
cat .git/HEAD

#Shows the hash of the last commit
cat .git/refs/heads/master

#Deletes a specified branch
git branch -d <branch>

Merge conflict happens when there's two different commits to the same file/area between two different branches.
Fix the conflicting changes on the file to overcome a merge conflict.



-------------------------------------
10. Rebasing

Alternative to merging. Replays changes made to one branch over the top of another.

#Replays changes made to a branch onto another branch.
git rebase <branch>

Cleans up history as changes done in branch are done in the branch to be committed to. Good when there are multiple branches being worked on.


------------------------------------
11. Reverting a commit

Revert a commit if you dun messed up.

#Removes a change, but retains a historical record of the change. Note, this is basically a new commit that removes the old one, not just an undo.
git revert <commit>

Revert from HEAD is the most recent commit, can also do via the commit number, or HEAD~# where # is the number of commits back from head.



-------------------------------------
12. diff

Views changes between different files and commits.

#Shows change in working tree.
git diff

#Shows what would be commited to head if you were to commit to head during then.
git diff HEAD^ HEAD


#Can also see diff between two different commits as well.
git diff <commit 1> <commit 2>

#Doesnt show contents, but other data like files added/deleted. Useful if you don't care about file contents and just want to see more general info.
git diff <commit 1> <commit 2


------------------------------------
13. Garbage Collection

Maintenance should be done on a repo every once in a while as it grows in size.

#Cleans out old objects that can't be referenced by the database anymore and compresses contents in the git directory to save space.
git gc

#By default, cleans out objects older than two weeks. Time frame can be specified.
git gc --prune


#Checks to see if repo needs to be cleaned. Exits without doing anything if it oesn't.
git gc --auto

#Creates a job to automatically do the pruning so that it doesn't need to be done manually.
git config gc.pruneexpire "# days"


-------------------------------------------
14. Git Logging

#show a textual graph of a project's commit history
git log --graph

#show statistics of the files w/ each commits
git log --stat

#Shows a summarized version of stats
git log --shortstat

#format the output of a git log command to display specific fields. See man pages for all available options
git log --pretty=format:"Input format here."

Some options available to put in the format string:
%h - abbreviated hash of the commit
%an - Author's name for the commit
%ar - relative time of the commit by the Author
%s - subject line of the commit

example: git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an - %ar - %s"


#Shows log activity from specified number of time. # days ago
git log --since="<time>"

#looks for logs for a specific line of textual
git log -S <search string>

#Shows log information in one line
git log --oneline
