Input/Output Redirection:

3 things to remember for redirection:
  stdin = keyboard
  stdout = screen
  stderror = error outputs

Common use of output is to collect output of a command into a file.
  ex.; ls -al > listing - store in a file named listing. Maybe do this to check later instead of it staying on the screen.

  > - only overwrites.
  >> - Appends to the end of a file.

  ls -al > listing vs ls -al >> listing

Input Redirection - like redirect output, you can also redirect where the system is getting input from.
  sort < listing.

Can also combine both input and output redirection into one command:
  sort < listing > sorted_list. Output goes to sorted_list file.

Pipes

Used to take output of one command and feed directly it into another.
  ls -l /var/log | less
  du | sort -nr
  ls -l | wc -l
  tar -tzvf tarfile.tgz | less

Error Redirection

Errors go to error output
  ls -fake 2> error - error outputs go to a file called error.
  ls -fake 2> error 2>&1 - Redirects error in error to stdout.
