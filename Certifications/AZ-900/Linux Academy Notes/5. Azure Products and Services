Compute: Azure Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, App Service, and Functions
---------------------------------------

VMs - On-demand scalable computing resource.
Choose CPU/RAM ou need. Most control over server.

VM Scale Sets - Auto-scalig pool of VMs. Centrally manage, config, and update a large number of them.

App service - On-demand, autoscaling, web/mobile/api app hosting. Linux and Windows platforms. Don't need to manage infrastructure.

Serverless - Event-driven, serverless compute resources. Auto-scale on demand. Pay only for what you consume.
Closest to true pay for what you consume. Least amount of control.



Networking: Azure Virtual Network, Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway, and Content Delivery Network
---------------------------------------

Azure Virtual Network - A network within Azure, that can securely talk to its own group of resources, not other organizations' resources.
Let you isolate networks based on needed security.

Azure VPN Gateway - Used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-prem location over public internet or between Azure virtual networks overs Microsoft network

Azure load balancer - balance incoming internet traffic to your VMs

Azure app gateway - web traffic load balancer that's even more customizable than Azure LBs
More fine-tuned load balancer.

Azure CDN - Efficiently delivers web content from locations that are close to end users to minimize latency.
Minimize load times and latency for static content.


Azure Blob Storage, Files, and Archive Storage
---------------------------------------

IaaS:
    Disks - usually VHDs. Premium options have SSD options.
    Files - Full scale file system to manage files. Can also store VHDs as well. Supports SMB, and rest api.

PaaS:
    Blobs - Object store. Can store basically any kind of data. Usually used to store unstructured data, like JSON. Can't really query data. Pull data based on endpoint ID.
    Tables - NoSQL database. More closely resembles a database than blobs. Massive autoscalin capabilities. Can support Petabytes of data.
    Queues - FIFO messages stored there. First one saved, first one processed. Takes data in, processes it when you're ready.

Hot Tier - Highest cost, but fastest access for data.
Cold Tier - Less than hot, speed decreases, but cheaper than hot tier.
Archive tier - substantially lower price point. Can take up to four hours to get data back for. Cheapest.



Databases: Azure CosmosDB, SQL Database, Database Migration Service, and SQL Data Warehouse
---------------------------------------

Azure Cosmos DB - Newest offering in Azure as of LA video. NoSQL database. Globally distributed, multi-model.
Auto-scalable across multiple regions. Supports multiple APIs, including SQL, MongoDB, etc. Write queries in those languages, Cosmos is OK with it.
Analytics via Apachi Spark. 

Azure SQL Database - Can come in IaaS or PaaS option.
    IaaS - Install SQL on an Azure VM. Pay as you go.
    PaaS - Fully managed engine by Microsoft. Available as single database, elastic pool, managed instances.

Azure SQL Data Warehouse - Cloud-based enterprise data warehouse. Made for storing large amount of data.
Leverages massively parallel processing (MPP) to quickly run complex queries across petabytes of data. Key component of a big data solution.
Data warehouse stores the results of analytics and reporting in a massive store of data so you can reference it in the future.

Azure Database Migration Service - Enables seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime.
    Offline migration - Application downtime starts when the migration starts
    Online migration - Downtime is limited to the time to cut over at the end of the migration.



Azure Marketplace
---------------------------------------

An online apps and services marketplace with over 8,000 listings. Like the app store for Azure.
Made by Microsoft and Microsoft partners.

Can have offerins like VMs, SaaS applications, solutions templates, and Azure Managed Apps.
