Public Cloud Model
---------------------------------------

Multi-tenant implementation. Multiple customers are sharing storage and servers on the same machine.
Owned and operated by service provider. Bound by multi-tenant data management policies.
Similar self-service and automation as private cloud.

Pros:
    No upfront capex
    No maintenance
    high reliability
    easy scalability

Cons:
    less customizable
    potential latency
    potential governance issues. Some industries have more restrictions than others.

Much cheaper for Microsoft to put multiple customers on one servers



Private Cloud Model
---------------------------------------

Private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organization.
Single tenant implementation. Owned and operated by IT org. Define your own data management policies.
Self-service and automation capabilities provide new agility.

Pros:
    Fully customizable
    Higher level of security
    Better performance

Cons
    Higher upfront capex
    Risk under-utilization of resources
    Higher ongoing costs
    More maintenance



Hybrid Cloud Model
---------------------------------------

Combination for private & one or more public clouds.  Allows IT organizations to become brokers for services. 
On-prem + Azure combo is considered a hybrid cloud.

Pros:
    Greater flexibility
    Resilience to outages
    No capacity ceiling
    Manageable security

Cons:
    High up-front capex
    Risk under-utilization of resources
    Higher ongoing costs
    More maintenance
    Risk of less compatibility



Comparing and Contrasting the Three Cloud Models
---------------------------------------

Public - When you don't need much customization and don't need as much governance

Hybrid - When you're transitioning to cloud or need more security than public
