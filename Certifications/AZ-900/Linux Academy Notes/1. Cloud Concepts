High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery
---------------------------------------

High availability - Maintaining acceptable continuous performance despite temporary load fluctuations or failures in services, hardware, or data centers
    Achieved by:
        - Data center redundancies - Power, Cooling, Networking, etc.

        - Availability zone redundancies - 1+ data centers

        - Region redundancies - Multiple availability zones


Fault Tolerance - System's ability to continue operating properly when one or more of its components fails.
    Can be done proactively or reactively:
        Proactive:
            - Regular backups
            - Deploy to multiple availability zones/regions
            - Loan balance across multiple zones/regions
            - Monitoring

        Reactive:
            - Restore data/apps/resources to different zones/regions
            - Deploy to different zones/regions if one goes down

Disaster Recovery - System's ability to back up and restore data/apps/resources when needed.
    Azure can restore in multiple different ways:
        - On-prem to On-prem with Azure being a middleman
        - On-prem to Azure
        - Other cloud to Azure
        - Azure to Azure



Scalability and Elasticity
---------------------------------------

Scalability - Ability to increase the size/instance count of existing resources
    Scaling Out - Increase instance count of resources. Non-disruptive
    Scaling Up - Increase instance size of existing resources. Disruptive


Elasticity - Abiity to increase/decrease instance count/size of existing resources based on traffic fluctuations, load, or resource workload.
    - Ability to scale in both directions. In + Out, Up + down
    - Can be manual or auto.
    - Pay for only what you use.
    - Based on changes in load or workload.



Business Agility
---------------------------------------
An organization's ability to rapidly adapt to market and 
environmental changes in productive and 
cost-effective ways while 
taking advantage of available resources to meet customer demands

    Time to Value - Get new products to market ASAP with shorter feedback cycles. Faster return on investment
    Innovation - Always look for better way of doing things using newer and better tech
    Low latency - Sooner a decision can be acted upon, sooner business knows whether decision was right and what else needs to be done.
   
    Economic effectiveness - Cost-effective processes and use of resources
    Rapid adaptation - Continually monitoring and adapting to changing market conditions
    Flexibility - Move quickly to take advantage of new opportunities



Economies of scale
---------------------------------------

The more you buy, the less it costs. Microsoft has more buying power than smaller companies, so companies can take advantage of this through Azure than doing it themselves.



CapEx and OpEx
---------------------------------------

CapEx - Up-front investment. Creates benefits over a long period of time. Usually non-recurring and related to perchase of permanent assets.

OpEx - No up-front investment. Creates immediate benefits, recurring cost of doing business. Not usually related to purchase of permanent assets.

Azure shifts infrastructure from a CapEx model to an OpEx one.



Consumptionb-Based Model
---------------------------------------

"Pay as you go" - This is Azure's purchase model. Only purchase the resources that you need, when you need it.

With on-prem, you may experience significant lag time before you can meet customer demand in order to provision new servers.
This can mean customer dissatisfaction during this time while servers are being purchased and set up.

Azure can prevent this by always being available to meet demand.

Only pay what you use in Azure, instead of spikes and pits that on-prem may have.
