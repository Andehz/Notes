High Availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery
---------------------------------------

High availability - Maintaining acceptable continuous performance despite temporary load fluctuations or failures in services, hardware, or data centers
    Achieved by:
        - Data center redundancies - Power, Cooling, Networking, etc.

        - Availability zone redundancies - 1+ data centers

        - Region redundancies - Multiple availability zones


Fault Tolerance - System's ability to continue operating properly when one or more of its components fails.
    Can be done proactively or reactively:
        Proactive:
            - Regular backups
            - Deploy to multiple availability zones/regions
            - Loan balance across multiple zones/regions
            - Monitoring

        Reactive:
            - Restore data/apps/resources to different zones/regions
            - Deploy to different zones/regions if one goes down

Disaster Recovery - System's ability to back up and restore data/apps/resources when needed.
    Azure can restore in multiple different ways:
        - On-prem to On-prem with Azure being a middleman
        - On-prem to Azure
        - Other cloud to Azure
        - Azure to Azure


Scalability and Elasticity
---------------------------------------

Scalability - Ability to increase the size/instance count of existing resources
    Scaling Out - Increase instance count of resources. Non-disruptive
    Scaling Up - Increase instance size of existing resources. Disruptive


Elasticity - Abiity to increase/decrease instance count/size of existing resources based on traffic fluctuations, load, or resource workload.
    - Ability to scale in both directions. In + Out, Up + down
    - Can be manual or auto.
    - Pay for only what you use.
    - Based on changes in load or workload.
