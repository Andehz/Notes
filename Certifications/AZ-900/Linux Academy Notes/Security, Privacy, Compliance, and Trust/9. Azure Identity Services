Authentication and Authorization
---------------------------------------

Authentication - Who are you. AuthN

Authorization - What you can do. AuthZ
Claims used in Azure AD security tokens. Piece of text that tells you what kind of access they have, and other info about the session. Very customizable.
Web App can use a claim to determine what kind of access to give a user.

Many different ways to handle these in Azure.



MFA
---------------------------------------

Requires two or more of the following authn methods:
    - Something you know (typically a p/w)
    - Something you have (A trusted device that's not easily duplicated, like a phone)
    - Something you are (biometrics)

Step up from regular authentication. Use two or more different means to authn a user.

Make it harder for an attacker to compromise your identity.

Give ourselves additional security online.



Azure Active Directory (AAD)
---------------------------------------

Comprehensive, highly available identity and access management cloud solution
Fully managed identity service. Main objects are user (pay per user) and groups (free)
Users are assigned a license based on which edition of Azure AD they should have.
Groups can be assigned multiple licenses, which are inherited by all Users in the Group

Use Azure AD Sync to sync Azure AD and on-prem AD.
