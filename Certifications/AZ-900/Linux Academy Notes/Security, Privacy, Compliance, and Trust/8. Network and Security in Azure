Azure Firewall
---------------------------------------

Managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure VN resources.
Centrally create, enforce, and log app and network connectivity policies across subs and VNs.
Fully integrated with monitor for logging and analytics.

Spoke Net (From hub and spoke network topologies)

All traffic is denied by default.

Can also filter on-prem  traffic to Azure as well.

High availability is built in, so no additional load balancers are requred and nothing to config.

Threat intelligence - uses machine learning and analytics to automatically deny traffic to and from known malicious IPs and domains.



Network Security Groups (NSGs)
---------------------------------------

Enforce and control network traffic rules at the networking level.
Security rules allow or deny inbound or outbound network to and from several types of Azure resources.
Each rule, can specify source, destination, port, and protocol.

Collection of a set of rules is an NSG. Specify Name, region, etc.

Rules are evaluated as traffic comes in to Azure.

Priority can be set as well to evaluate which rules run first. 1 is first, anything higher than that comes after.

NSGs and firewalls don't encrypt your traffic.



Azure DDoS Protection
---------------------------------------

Two types of Azure DDoS Protection   
    Basic 
    Standard



Choosing an Azure Security Solution
---------------------------------------

Isolation - Use different VNs, subnets, to segment your network or isolate your resources when required.

Principle of Least Privilege - Limit each user's access rights to bare minimum permissions they need to perform their work.

User NSGs for Bare Minimum Network Connectivity - use NSGs to enforce rules allowing only the min network access needed.

Use Azure Firewall and Azure DDoS Protection - Use Azure Firewall and Azure DDoS Protection to protect your resources and prevent large unanticipated costs.
