Internet of Things (IoT): Azure IoT Hub and IoT Central
---------------------------------------

IoT solution is made of 1+ IoT devices and 1+ back-end services running in cloud that communicate with each other.
Usually have sensors and connect to the net.

Azure IoT Central:
    - Fully managed SaaS solution
    - Easily connect, monitor, and manage your IoT devices/assets at scale.
    - Collaborative, drag-n-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy IoT solutions without needing to write code.

    Preconfigured solutions for common IoT scenarios.

Azure IoT Hub:
    - Core Azure PaaS messaging service used by Azure IoT Central.
    - Enables reliable and secure bidirectional communications between millions of IoT devices and cloud solution

    This is the behind-the-scenes solution IoT Central uses.



Big Data and Analytics: Azure SQL Data Warehouse, HDInsight, and Data Lake Analytics
---------------------------------------

Storing data to later use to review for the busienss in the future in some manner.

Azure SQL Data Warehouse - Cloud-based enterprise data warehouse. EDW

Azure HDInsight - Open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of Big Data sets on clusters.
Process massive amounts of data.

Azure Data Lake - On-demand analytics job service. Process data on demand, pay only per job.


Everything generates data, and we want to save it for future analytics in some way. 
Store results of analytics into a data warehouse to reference later.


Artificial Intelligence (AI): Azure Machine Learning Service and Machine Learning Studio
---------------------------------------

Machine Learning - data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.
Computers learn without being explicitly programmed to do it. Programs use pattern recognition to perform predictive behaviors.


Azure Machine Learning Services - Provides a cloud-based environment you can use to prep data and train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models.
Python environment, if you want more control over your machine learning algorthims, or use open-source machine learning libraries.

Azure Machine Learning Studio - Collaborative drag-and-drop visual workspace version.
Uses prebuilt and preconfigured machine learning algorithms and data handling modules.
Use this if you want pre-built solutions and the built-in algorithms are sufficient for you.



Serverless Computing: Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Event Grid
---------------------------------------

Don't need to worry about any underlying infrastructure to deploy and run code. Only charged for compute time.
Much less administration and management.


Azure Functions - Configure your code to load and run only when triggered. More for single, simple tasks.
Can be triggered with HTTP requests, dasta from other Azure services, etc.
Can return data or call other Azure services.

Azure Logic Apps - visual designer for automating and orchestrating tasks, processes, and workflows. More for full-on workflows.
100+ Azure and 3rd party services.
For integrating apps/data/systems for B2B integrations.

Azure Event Grid - fully managed event routing service.
Greatly simplifies the development of event-based apps and serverless workflows.
Handles all event routing from any source, to any destination for any app.


Benefits of Azure Solutions
---------------------------------------

Use pre-built or pre-packages solutions reduces costs and shortens the time it takes to set up, configure, and deploy your apps.
Lower skill level needed to set up and administer solutions. Hire general practitioners rather than needed SMEs.
Spend more time focusing on your business and apps, not connecting various Azure services together.

Designed to be very scalable, manage resources simply, faster time to market, lower costs overall.
