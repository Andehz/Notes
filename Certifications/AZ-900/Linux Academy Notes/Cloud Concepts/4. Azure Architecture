Regions
---------------------------------------

Regions - Group of multiple azure data centers. Within a certain distance of each other, latency defined.

Multi-region deployment - deploy to multiple regions.

    Active/passive - Fail over to another region instantly if another region goes bad. Comes at a higher cost though.
    Should be transparent to end user. Best when all users are in the same region.

    Active/active - Distribute traffic/load across regions. Resilience to outages in entire regions.
    Best when users are in different regions.



Availability Zones
---------------------------------------

Unique area of physical locations made up of one or more data centers
Allow for high-availability by protecting your apps and data from data center failures.
Some Azure services can be deployed to two or more availability zones within an Azure region.

Always 2+ availability zones within a region.

Deploy to multiple availability zones to prevent localised disasters from crippling operations.



Resource Groups
---------------------------------------

Container of related Azure services grouped together. Administrative group created by users.

All resources in the group should share the same lifecycle, deployed, updated, and deleted together.

Resources can exist in only one resource group.

Resource roup can contain resources that are located in different regions.

Resource group can be used to scope access control for admin actions.

Resource can interact with resources in other resource groups. Just for managing resource lifecycle.



Azure Resource Center (ARM)
---------------------------------------

Deployment and Management services. Provides consistent management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources, including templates.
Single pane of glass for management of Azure.

Can use its access control, auditing, and tagging features to gain better insight into your organization and resource usage after deployment.

Repeatedly deploy solution throughout development lifecycle and have confidence resources are deployed in a consistent state.

Can even set up dependencies so they're deployed in correct order through declarative templates. templates in JSON.

Resource manager is the single central API to manage Azure resources. Everything goes through ARM.



Azure Usage and Benefits
---------------------------------------

Availability Zones - Allow for high availability by protecting your app and data from data center failures

Regions - Deploying your apps/systems to multiple regions allows for high availability and resiliency to region-wide outages.

Resource groups - Containers of related Azure services grouped together for administrative and access control actions

ARM - single, centralized deployment and management service that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure sub.
