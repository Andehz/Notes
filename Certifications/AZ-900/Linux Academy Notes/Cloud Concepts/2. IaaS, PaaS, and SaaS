IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
---------------------------------------

VMs, VNETs.

On-Prem, you must manage everything.

Iaas - Microsoft will manage Networking, Storage, servers, virtualization. You'll only have to manage OS, middleware, runtime, data, and apps.
This is the most control you can have in Azure over your resources. Microsoft handles the infrastructure. You handle the software part.

Pros:
    Total control over a good portion of resources.
    No up-front costs.
    No physical infrastructure to manage.
    Easy way to transition, manage, and scaling options.

Cons:
    More management and administration.
    More staff
    Higher cost

Pretty convenenient way to manage, and already how a lot of organizations run anyway.



PaaS - Platform as a Service
---------------------------------------

Microsoft will manage everything up to Runtime. You'll only need to manage data and applications.

Azure Storage, Azure Search, Azure Sql, Azure app service are PaaS models. For example, you wouldn't even need to know how to config IIS with PaaS models in Azure.

Pros:
    Less management and administration
    No up-front costs, pay as you go.
    No OS/Middleware to manage
    Easier to replicate environments
    Easy scaling
    Quicker development and deployment

Cons:
    Less control over resources
    Data is stored off-site, must consider security and compliance.



SaaS - Software as a Service
---------------------------------------

Microsoft will manage everything. This includes the application as well. For a monthly fee, you can consume the software.
Not many SaaS options in Azure.


Pros:
    No management and administration
    No up-front costs.
    No physical infra to manage
    Fast setup
    Anyone can use infrastructure

Cons:
    Much less customizable.
    No constrol over software or infrastructure
    Integration with other software may be difficult
    Vendor may have access to customer data. (Consider your compliance needs.)



Compare and Contrast
---------------------------------------

Each service delegates a certain amount of resources to Microsoft for them to manage. On-prem is the opposite of the mentioned three where you must manage everything in the stack.

IaaS - Most generic approach, and most customizable. Consider management and administration costs.
PaaS - For more generic boilerplate applications, like web servers and web apps. Everything should be built with the cloud in mind, aka cloud-native.
SaaS - Don't need to set anything up. Great when management and control isn't needed very much. Email, Facebook, Google Docs, etc. All SaaS models.
    Least used model as there aren't as many offerings.

Comes down to how much you want or need.
